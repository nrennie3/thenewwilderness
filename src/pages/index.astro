			<h1>The New Wilderness</h1>
			<p>
				We are living through an unprecedented moment. Artificial intelligence is reshaping how we work,
				learn, communicate, and raise our children — faster than any of us anticipated. For families of
				faith, this is not just a technological shift. It is a spiritual one.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a place for honest conversation about navigating that wilderness — with clear eyes,
				deep roots, and primary allegiance to the Creator rather than the machine.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here you will find articles, reflections, practical frameworks, and the occasional difficult
				question about what it means to raise a family, hold a faith, and remain fully human in the
				age of AI.
