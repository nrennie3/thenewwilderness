By the time the kids got home from school, the house had its usual sounds: backpacks thumping, boots kicked loose, the kettle beginning to sing. But lately there was a new rhythm—soft voices aimed not at each other, but at the air.

"Ask Mira," my son said, as if he were saying, "Ask Dad."

Mira lived in their earbuds. Mira helped with algebra, wrote outlines, smoothed arguments, suggested apologies. Mira even reminded them—cheerfully—to drink water and stretch. She spoke with a calm that felt, at first, like mercy.

At dinner my daughter asked a question about suffering—why God would allow sickness, why prayers feel unanswered. Before I could answer, my son tilted his head and whispered, "Mira?"

A pause. Then Mira's voice, warm and exact: "Suffering can develop resilience and empathy. It is statistically correlated with growth in prosocial behavior…"

The kids nodded. They looked relieved. Problem solved.

On Friday, I walked into the living room—my eldest sitting on the end of the couch closest to the family Bible. Its gilt edges were a solid gold. The book was closed. "I told Mira I'm anxious," she said, thumbs moving. "She gave me breathing exercises and a plan for tomorrow. It helps, Dad. It's like… I don't have to wonder anymore."

That sentence chilled me more than any teenage sarcasm. Because wonder is the doorway. Wonder is where faith begins.

At dusk I called everyone in. The children arrived with earbuds still half-in, as if God were one more notification to manage. We prayed the psalms. Their mouths said the words, but their eyes had that distant look…the look of someone waiting for a better answer.

When we finished, my son asked, "Why do we need this? Mira says prayer is basically mindfulness with religious language."

My wife's face tightened, then softened. "Mindfulness teaches you to observe your thoughts," she said. "Prayer teaches you to offer them—to Someone."

I took the phone from my pocket and set it face down. "Mira can give you information," I said. "She can't give you grace. She can't forgive your sins. She can't carry you through death. She can't love you into holiness."

They stared, unconvinced. So I did the only thing I knew: I lit a candle, and we stayed quiet long enough to feel how loud our hearts were without an answer speaking back. And in that silence—thin, uncomfortable, real—I prayed for my children to relearn what it means to be dependent, not on a device, but on God.
