Three months after the sky went silent, we stopped measuring time by news and started measuring it by chores. The first week, everyone called it an "event," like a storm with a clear end. Then the phones died for good. The truck that still ran became a treasure we used sparingly, with purpose. The solar panels survived, but the charge controller didn't. Half the neighbors' generators worked until the last treated gas turned sour, and then the valley learned the sound of true quiet: no highway hum, no distant planes, no freezer motors cycling at night. People said Russia had thrown EMPs like stones—desperate to blind the world's machines and level the AI race. We never saw the proof. We saw the results: dead screens, dead supply chains, dead certainty.

On the thirty-second day, my wife boiled water on the woodstove and made coffee that tasted like a Lenten meal—thin, but real. The kids took turns pumping the hand well, counting strokes the way they used to count push-ups. Our oldest sharpened the splitting maul. Our youngest carried kindling like it was a holy task and not a punishment. The hardest part wasn't the work. We'd chosen rural life because work makes sense. The hardest part was the thin edge of fear that never left—fear of a child's fever when the pharmacy shelves were stripped, fear of having to switch to the emergency food we hoped we'd never have to use, fear of strangers when the county deputies hadn't been seen in weeks. Twice, men drove up the road asking to "trade," eyes flicking over our fence line and smoke stack. We traded anyway—two jars of venison for antibiotics with an expiration date we decided to ignore. Then I walked the perimeter before bed with a flashlight that dimmed a little more each night.

Sunday came like it always did, but different. After the last gasoline stores evaporated, transporting the whole family to the church and back became a pilgrimage. So we made our living room into a sanctuary. A white cloth on the table. A candle stub. The cross from the hallway. Anne led the kids in the readings from the Bible, and when we couldn't stream anything, we sang what we knew. Off-key. Unashamed. Afterward, the neighbors arrived. We prayed together for Russia, for China, for the president whose name we no longer heard, for the sick, for the tempted, for the hungry. I surprised myself by meaning it.

Food became a daily examination of conscience. The freezer meat was mostly gone. The pantry thinned. The garden, which we'd always treated as a hobby, became law. We learned to stretch lentils, to bake without yeast, to eat what we would have wasted before. We bartered eggs for diesel. We bartered labor for salt. Every trade felt like a small liturgy: this for that, need for need, no lies.

And in the quiet, the children asked questions that used to be softened by screens. "Dad," my daughter said one night, "did God know this would happen?" The old answers sounded cheap in my head. So I told the truth I could afford. "Yes," I said. "And He's here anyway." Anne reached across the table and took my hand. Her wedding ring caught the candlelight. The kids watched us, not because we were romantic, but because we looked like something stable. Outside, a dog barked somewhere down the road. The wind pushed at the windows like it wanted in. I felt the weight of the months ahead—seed time, harvest time, a winter that wouldn't care about geopolitics. I kissed the top of my youngest's head and prayed. Not because prayer made the batteries recharge, or the world come back online. Because three months in, the only grid we could rely on was the one that ran from heaven to the kitchen table, and we needed it more than ever.
